		The APK Signature Verifier is an <a
			href="http://appvet.github.io/appvet/">AppVet-</a>compatible online
		tool that wraps the Oracle
		<code>jarsigner</code>
		tool to verify the signatures and integrity of Android APK files. As
		described in the <a class="underline"
			href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jarsigner.html"
			target="_blank"> Oracle jarsigner documentation</a> for JAR files, a
		successful APK file verification occurs if the signature(s) are valid,
		and none of the files that were in the APK file when the signatures
		were generated have been changed since then. APK file verification
		involves the following steps:
	<ul>
		<li>Verify the signature of the .SF file (i.e., signature file)
			itself. That is, the verification ensures that the signature stored
			in each signature block (.DSA) file was in fact generated using the
			private key corresponding to the public key whose certificate (or
			certificate chain) also appears in the .DSA file. It also ensures
			that the signature is a valid signature of the corresponding
			signature (.SF) file, and thus the .SF file has not been tampered
			with.</li>
		<li>Verify the digest listed in each entry in the .SF file with
			each corresponding section in the manifest.
			<p>The .SF file by default includes a header containing a hash of
				the entire manifest file. When the header is present, then the
				verification can check to see whether or not the hash in the header
				indeed matches the hash of the manifest file. If that is the case,
				verification proceeds to the next step.</p>
			<p>If that is not the case, a less optimized verification is
				required to ensure that the hash in each source file information
				section in the .SF file equals the hash of its corresponding section
				in the manifest file (see The Signature (.SF) File).</p>
			<p>One reason the hash of the manifest file that is stored in the
				.SF file header may not equal the hash of the current manifest file
				would be because one or more files were added to the APK file (using
				the jar tool) after the signature (and thus the .SF file) was
				generated. When the jar tool is used to add files, the manifest file
				is changed (sections are added to it for the new files), but the .SF
				file is not. A verification is still considered successful if none
				of the files that were in the APK file when the signature was
				generated have been changed since then, which is the case if the
				hashes in the non-header sections of the .SF file equal the hashes
				of the corresponding sections in the manifest file.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Read each file in the APK file that has an entry in the .SF
			file. While reading, compute the file's digest, and then compare the
			result with the digest for this file in the manifest section. The
			digests should be the same, or verification fails.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	If any serious verification failures occur during the verification
	process, the process is stopped and a security exception is thrown. It
	is caught and displayed by jarsigner.


	<h3 id="scans">Risk Mappings</h3>
	The
	<code>jarsigner</code>
	tool generates a report that is scanned by the APK Signature Verifier
	to identify a risk assessment (i.e.,
	<code>LOW</code>
	,
	<code>MODERATE</code>
	, or
	<code>HIGH</code>
	risk). The following shows the mappings between report items and risk
	assessments. Note that the default risk assessment is set to
	<code>LOW</code>
	.
	<pre>
<code>
   &lt;appvet:Result&gt;
      &lt;appvet:DefaultStatus&gt;LOW&lt;/appvet:DefaultStatus&gt;
      &lt;appvet:Low&gt;jar verified.&lt;/appvet:Low&gt;
      &lt;appvet:Moderate&gt;jar contains unsigned entries which have not been integrity-checked&lt;/appvet:Moderate&gt;
      &lt;appvet:Moderate&gt;jar contains entries whose signer certificate has expired&lt;/appvet:Moderate&gt;
      &lt;appvet:Moderate&gt;jar contains entries whose certificate chain is not validated&lt;/appvet:Moderate&gt;
      &lt;appvet:Moderate&gt;jar contains signatures that does not include a timestamp&lt;/appvet:Moderate&gt;
      &lt;appvet:High&gt;java.lang.SecurityException&lt;/appvet:High&gt;
   &lt;/appvet:Result&gt;
</code>
</pre>
